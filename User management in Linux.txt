
User management in Linux
************************ 

1. Root user ------ who has full acess i.e read, write and execute

2. Normal user ---- will not have full access 

# ---- It is a root user 

$ ----- It is a normal user




Normal user can take the previleges(read, write and execute) of root user using ---sudo command ---

apt install git ---- by root user 

sudo apt install git --- by normal user 

normal user should be in sudo group then only it works 



cat /etc/shadow | grep "username" ------ It will show the particular user

cat /etc/os-release ----- used to show what type of os you are using


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How can we create a user 
************************

useradd username  ---- you should set the password separately ---- It won't create  /home with same name   ------ useradd username --- it will create the directory

eg: useradd Raghav
    passwd Raghav-----then set the password

root@Srujan21:~# id Raghav
uid=1004(Raghav) ------user id 
gid=1004(Raghav) ------ primary or default group of user (Raghav)
 groups=1004(Raghav)----- secondary group of user (Raghav)




adduser username ----- you can create a password --- can create /home dir with same name

users list are seen/stored in --- cat /etc/shadow

To list all users on the system ----- cat /etc/passwd -----> It shows all users 

we can also see whether the user exists or not by checking ----id username

groups are seen/stored in --- cat /etc/gshadow 

groupadd groupname (for creating groups)



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


When you create a new normal user with the same name a directory is created in ----/home --> when you use adduser command

/root ---- home for the root user 
/home --- home for the normal users

ls -ld username ---- is used to show the specific directory


when ever you create
* file 
* dir
* link 

They have two types of owners -----userowner and  groupowner

drwxr-x--- 5 srujan srujan 4096 Feb 24 08:19 srujan
		|	|
	(userowner) (groupowner)


we can change userowner and groupowner  by using command ----chown

we can add a group to the groupowner ---- usermod/gpasswd -aG(for all groups) group1 linuxuser1------

usermod -aG groupname username --- used to add group to secondary groups for the username

To change the primary group of the user --------usermod -g groupname username
 
groupdel username(groupname) ---> If will delete the group permanently in user and group also

gpasswd -d username groupname ------  used to delete the group  in the secondary group


userdel -r username -------used to delete the user permanently in the home directory also 

If we want to delete a user ---- userdel username ( It deletes the user but doesnot delete the user in home directory )
